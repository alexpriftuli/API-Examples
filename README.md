## Public API V6.0 SDKs
All libraries in the **SDKs** directory were auto-generated using [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). We will continue building out these SDKs based on feedback given to us. Please submit Pull Requests and leave comments on this repository.

## Public API V6.0 Swagger
The MINDBODY Public API now supplies an [OpenAPI Specification document](https://api.mindbodyonline.com/public/v6/swagger/doc) and an [in-browser UI](https://api.mindbodyonline.com/public/v6/swagger/index) for exploring V6 endpoints.

If you do not see an SDK for your programming language, you can use [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to generate API clients for that language.
